# Pick a Box with UR3 Robot

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project in **2147308 Industrial Robot**, a course offered by the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering program at the International School of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University. The project involves programming a UR3 robot to grab a box from a conveyor belt using computer vision and a gripper.

## Project Description:

The robot needs to identify and grab one out of two boxes moving on a conveyor belt at 1 cm/s. The initial position and orientation of the first box are random within a certain range. The robot starts at a known location and must grab the box before it reaches the middle point of the conveyor belt.

## Features:

- Uses a camera to identify the box on the conveyor belt.
- Controls the UR3 robot to grab the box using a gripper.
- Handles grabbing retries in case of failure.
